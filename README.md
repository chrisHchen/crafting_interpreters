# Introduction

---

This repo is my Java programming exercise for this great book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

it contains a java interpreter (jlox) to parse and execute a dynamically typed language called "[Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html)", whose syntax is very much like javascript.

Feel free to clone and play with it.

# usage

Run Lox.class from the command line and give it a path to a Lox source file, it reads the file and executes it.

Or Run Lox.class and returns an interactive command-line app that reads a line of input from the user.
